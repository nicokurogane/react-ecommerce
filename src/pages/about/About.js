        Darren DeMatas, MBA and co-founder of selfstartr Darren DeMatas, MBA and
        co-founder of Ecommerce CEO Have you ever had an awesome idea for an
        ecommerce business but weren’t sure exactly where to begin?
        Unfortunately, this happens to too many aspiring entrepreneurs. Starting
        your own ecommerce business is probably the best way to generate a
        steady stream of income but it can also be the most daunting, leaving
        many first-time entrepreneurs running for the hills. There is almost too
        much information out there and no great single resource to help you
        digest it all. Should I use Shopify or WooCommerce? Or how about for
        payments – Stripe or Paypal? And don’t get me started on fulfillment –
        Amazon or Shipwire? Stitching together the right technology to sell and
        ship product is just the first hurdle. For long-term success, you need
        to generate traffic, build customer trust and optimize your conversion
        rate. All while maintaining a profitable bottom line. Enter Ecommerce
        CEO. Our mission is to provide you with well-organized content for every
        single step of creating an ecommerce business with live examples. We
        take the complexity and the mystery out of ecommerce.
